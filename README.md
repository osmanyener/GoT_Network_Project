# GoT_Network_Project
I developed a Java Console application that applies BFS - DFS path algorithms to Game of Thrones characters

--> The project creates 1000x1000 Graphmatrix and the graph vertices are Series Characters. I used a hashtable to map SeriesCharacters into graph vertices: converting strings to integers as vertex numbers.  <br />
--> The project file includes GoT characters file (AllCharacters.txt) and example characters (ToyExample.txt). Both files includes 'name,name,edge-weights' in each line and edge-weights refer to the connection strength among two individual characters. <br />
--> You can see some screenshots of the project below. <br />
--> Also, the project has ability to run both files but you need to uncomment the necessarry lines in 'GraphMatrix.java' file.  <br />
